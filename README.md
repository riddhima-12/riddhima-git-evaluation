Git is a version control system (VCS) for tracking changes in project directory and manage source code. It is free and open source. A complete long-term change history of every file. This means every change made by many individuals over the years. Git takes snapshots of a project, and stores those snapshots as unique versions. Git is designed for distributed development. If you’re involved with a project you can clone the project’s Git repository, and then work on it as if it was the only copy in existence. Every developer’s working copy of the code is also a repository that can contain the full history of all changes. 

If you want to install the basic Git tools, go through Git installation URL There are many interfaces available for Git like GitHub, GitLab, Savannah, BitBucket, and SourceForge etc.
